 <b>Apps for a more consistent experience</b><br><br>
 Apps are organized into folders, which contain screenshots and a Readme explaining the use of each. <br>
 All apps are open source. I recommend using the <a href="https://scoop.sh">Scoop</a> package manager; it is super easy to use and has most of these apps.<br>Check out the <a href="https://uwpcommunity.com/projects">UWP Community</a> projects for a mega-list of such beautiful apps.<br><br>
 If you're looking for my personal configuration files, they can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/rashil2000/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repository.
 <br><br><small>The above screenshot was taken with Paint 3D. This Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/la6y7j/supercharge_your_screenshots/">thread</a> explains how in super easy steps.</small>
